# YOLOv3_tf2
YOLOv3 implemented with tensorflow 2

origin code is belongs to YunYang1994 [https://github.com/YunYang1994/TensorFlow2.0-Examples/tree/master/4-Object_Detection/YOLOV3] 

We implemented few things
1. loss function variation [ MISH, ReLu, GIoU, CIoU, Focal cross entropy, cross entropy]
2. @function decoration in tensorflow2
3. nvidia mixed_precision for enhanced speed
4. Architecture of YOLOv3 is modified for our work
